# 1. DICE SEMULATION
# Working of the Game:
I am using the time module and random module in this project. The game operates within two while loops:

First Loop:
Controls whether the player wants to play the game or exit.
Second Loop:
Handles the actual gameplay.
The first turn is always for the user.
The second turn is for the computer, which makes random moves using the random module.
Additional Features:
I am using user-defined functions to manage different parts of the game efficiently.
Only the user can stop the game by giving a command‚Äîthe computer will never stop on its own.
This makes the game more interactive and engaging, providing an interesting experience for the player.
# 2. HOTEL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

my project is a real-life Caf√© Management System that uses Python and MySQL with the mysql.connector module. It interacts with a MySQL database to store and manage the caf√©'s menu, allowing customers to place orders and generate bills.

How It Works:
1.The system performs SQL queries to fetch, insert, create, and delete data from the MySQL database.
2.It provides a user-friendly interface with logical loops and conditions to handle the order-taking process efficiently.
3.Customers can view the menu, place orders, confirm orders, and generate bills dynamically.
4.The system calculates the total bill based on selected items and their prices from the database.
5.It simulates a real caf√© environment, where waiters (referred to as "better" in the program) take orders and process payments.

# 3. LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
# working: This Python script implements a Library Management System that allows three types of users‚Äîteachers, students, and administrators‚Äîto log in and perform various tasks related to books. The system interacts with a MySQL database using the mysql.connector library and utilizes bcrypt for password hashing and authentication.
Main Components & Functionality:
1. User Authentication & Role-Based Access. 2. Teacher Login & Operations. 3. Student Login & Operations. 4. Admin Login & Privileges. 5. Database Connectivity & Queries
# 4. CONTACT APP

# 5. CONBANEGA CORORPATI APP
# Working of the Code:
This program is a quiz game inspired by Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC), where the player answers multiple-choice questions within a time limit of 10 seconds per question.

How It Works:
Modules Used:

The time module is imported to introduce a 10-second delay after each question.
Question Storage:

A list of dictionaries, list1, stores the questions along with four answer options (A, B, C, D).
The correct answers are stored separately in the answer list.
Game Start:

The user types "start" to begin the game.
Loop Execution:

The while True loop ensures the game runs continuously.
A prize money system starts at ‚Çπ10,000, increasing by ‚Çπ20,000 for each correct answer.
An index variable keeps track of the question number.
Asking Questions:

The program displays a question with answer options.
The user selects an option (A, B, C, or D).
If the answer is correct, the user wins money, and the game proceeds to the next question.
If the answer is wrong, the game ends immediately.
Time Delay:

After each question, the program waits for 10 seconds using time.sleep(10).
Game End:

If the player answers two questions correctly, the game exits the loop and ends.
Improvements Needed:
There's an issue in for i in list1, answer:‚Äîthis should be replaced with a proper iteration over list1.
The game should handle cases where the user doesn't enter a valid input.
A timer mechanism should be added to ensure the user responds within 10 seconds, rather than just pausing execution.

# 6. LUCKY GAME
# Working of the Lucky Game:
This is a simple luck-based betting game where the player wagers money and tries to match symbols to win rewards. The game uses random selection to determine outcomes, simulating a slot-machine-style experience.

How It Works:
Starting Balance:

The player starts with ‚Çπ50 in their wallet (balance=50).
Game Start:

The user is asked if they want to play ("y") or exit ("n").
If they choose "y", another menu is displayed with game options.
If they choose "n", the game ends.
Game Menu Options:

(1) Check Balance:
Displays the current balance.
If the balance is low, it suggests depositing money.
(2) Exit the Game:
Ends the game with a farewell message.
(3) Deposit Money:
The user can add money to their wallet.
(4) Play the Game:
The user enters a bet amount (amount1).
If the bet is higher than the balance, a warning is displayed.
If the bet is valid, the game randomly generates three symbols using the random.choice() function.
Winning Conditions:

Jackpot (Triple Match):
If all three symbols match, the player wins double their bet.
Close Win (Two Matches):
If only two symbols match, the player loses their bet but gets a message that they were close.
Total Loss (No Matches):
If none of the symbols match, the player loses the bet.
Game Loop:

The game continues until the player chooses to exit (choice == 2).
# 7. FILE MANAGER SYSTEM

# 10. STUDENT GRADING SIMPLE PROJECT
# Working of the Student Grading System
This project is a Student Grading System that allows users to enter student names and scores, assigns grades based on the scores, and calculates the class's average performance.

How the System Works
Class Definition (Student)

Uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to create a Student class.
The __init__ method initializes student name, score, and grade.
The display_info() method returns student details.
Function (determine_grade)

Determines the grade based on the student's score.
Uses an if-elif-else structure for grading:
A (90+)
B (70-89)
C (40-69)
Fail (Below 40)
Collecting Student Data (while True Loop)

Continuously asks for student name and score.
Creates a Student object and stores it in student_list.
Asks whether to add another student (yes/no).
If "no", the loop stops.
Calculating Average Score (for Loop)

Loops through student_list and sums up all student scores.
Computes the average score by dividing the total by the number of students.
Displaying Results

Prints all student details using display_info().
Displays the average score of the class.
Uses another if-elif condition to evaluate class performance:
90+ ‚Üí Excellent Performance
60-89 ‚Üí Poor Performance
Below 60 ‚Üí Not Good Performance
Concepts & Features Used
‚úÖ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) ‚Äì Class (Student), Objects, Methods
‚úÖ Functions ‚Äì determine_grade(score) for grading logic
‚úÖ Loops ‚Äì while loop for input collection, for loop for calculations
‚úÖ Conditional Statements ‚Äì if-elif-else for grading and performance evaluation

# 11. PASSWORD CHECKER SYSTEM
# Working of Password Strength Checker (Regex Library)
This project is a Password Strength Checker using Python's re (regex) module. It evaluates passwords based on different conditions to determine their strength.

How the System Works
User Selects Condition Type

The user is given two options:
1 ‚Üí Medium-hard password check
2 ‚Üí Simple password check
If an invalid choice is entered, an error message is displayed.
Medium-Hard Password Check (command == 1)

The function check_password(password) verifies the password based on the following conditions:
‚úÖ At least 8 characters long
‚úÖ Contains at least one digit (0-9)
‚úÖ Contains at least one uppercase letter (A-Z)
‚úÖ Contains at least one lowercase letter (a-z)
‚úÖ Contains at least one special character (~!@#$%^&*()_?><,.-)
If any condition fails, a message is displayed.
If all conditions pass, the password is considered "strong".
Simple Password Check (command == 2)

A basic version of the password checker:
Uses the same conditions but combines them into a single if condition.
If the password does not meet all criteria, the user is told to strengthen it.
Loop for Continuous Checking

Users can enter multiple passwords for checking.
Entering "exit" stops the program.
Concepts & Features Used
‚úÖ Regex (re library) ‚Äì Used for pattern matching (special characters)
‚úÖ Functions (check_password, check_passw) ‚Äì Code reusability
‚úÖ Loops (while True) ‚Äì Allows multiple password checks
‚úÖ Conditional Statements (if-elif-else) ‚Äì Checks password strength

# 12. SPELLING CHECKER  SYSTEM
# Working of the Spelling Checker (TextBlob)
This project is a Spelling Checker using the TextBlob library. It helps correct spelling mistakes in user input.

How the System Works
User Input

The user enters a word or sentence with possible spelling mistakes.
Using TextBlob for Correction

The function speling_check(leters) takes the input word and:
‚úÖ Uses TextBlob(leters).correct() to find the correct spelling.
‚úÖ If the spelling is already correct, it informs the user.
‚úÖ If the spelling is incorrect, it displays the corrected word.
Displaying Results

The corrected word is printed along with a message about whether it was correct or incorrect.
