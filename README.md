# 2. HOTEL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Your project is a real-life Café Management System that uses Python and MySQL with the mysql.connector module. It interacts with a MySQL database to store and manage the café's menu, allowing customers to place orders and generate bills.

How It Works:
1.The system performs SQL queries to fetch, insert, create, and delete data from the MySQL database.
2.It provides a user-friendly interface with logical loops and conditions to handle the order-taking process efficiently.
3.Customers can view the menu, place orders, confirm orders, and generate bills dynamically.
4.The system calculates the total bill based on selected items and their prices from the database.
5.It simulates a real café environment, where waiters (referred to as "better" in the program) take orders and process payments.

# 3. LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
--->working: This Python script implements a Library Management System that allows three types of users—teachers, students, and administrators—to log in and perform various tasks related to books.

Main Components & Functionality:
1. User Authentication & Role-Based Access. 2. Teacher Login & Operations. 3. Student Login & Operations. 4. Admin Login & Privileges. 5. Database Connectivity & Queries
