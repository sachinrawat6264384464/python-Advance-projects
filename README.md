# 1. DICE SEMULATION
Working of the Game:
I am using the time module and random module in this project. The game operates within two while loops:

First Loop:
Controls whether the player wants to play the game or exit.
Second Loop:
Handles the actual gameplay.
The first turn is always for the user.
The second turn is for the computer, which makes random moves using the random module.
Additional Features:
I am using user-defined functions to manage different parts of the game efficiently.
Only the user can stop the game by giving a command‚Äîthe computer will never stop on its own.
This makes the game more interactive and engaging, providing an interesting experience for the player.
# 2. HOTEL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

my project is a real-life Caf√© Management System that uses Python and MySQL with the mysql.connector module. It interacts with a MySQL database to store and manage the caf√©'s menu, allowing customers to place orders and generate bills.

How It Works:
1.The system performs SQL queries to fetch, insert, create, and delete data from the MySQL database.
2.It provides a user-friendly interface with logical loops and conditions to handle the order-taking process efficiently.
3.Customers can view the menu, place orders, confirm orders, and generate bills dynamically.
4.The system calculates the total bill based on selected items and their prices from the database.
5.It simulates a real caf√© environment, where waiters (referred to as "better" in the program) take orders and process payments.

# 3. LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
--->working: This Python script implements a Library Management System that allows three types of users‚Äîteachers, students, and administrators‚Äîto log in and perform various tasks related to books. The system interacts with a MySQL database using the mysql.connector library and utilizes bcrypt for password hashing and authentication.
Main Components & Functionality:
1. User Authentication & Role-Based Access. 2. Teacher Login & Operations. 3. Student Login & Operations. 4. Admin Login & Privileges. 5. Database Connectivity & Queries
# 4. CONTACT APP
Working of the Contact Diary App
The Contact Diary App is a Python-based application that allows users to store, search, count, and delete contacts using a MySQL database. It provides a menu-driven interface for easy interaction and ensures that contacts are securely stored and managed.

# 5. CONBANEGA CORORPATI APP
Working of the Code:
This program is a quiz game inspired by Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC), where the player answers multiple-choice questions within a time limit of 10 seconds per question.

How It Works:
Modules Used:

The time module is imported to introduce a 10-second delay after each question.
Question Storage:

A list of dictionaries, list1, stores the questions along with four answer options (A, B, C, D).
The correct answers are stored separately in the answer list.
Game Start:

The user types "start" to begin the game.
Loop Execution:

The while True loop ensures the game runs continuously.
A prize money system starts at ‚Çπ10,000, increasing by ‚Çπ20,000 for each correct answer.
An index variable keeps track of the question number.
Asking Questions:

The program displays a question with answer options.
The user selects an option (A, B, C, or D).
If the answer is correct, the user wins money, and the game proceeds to the next question.
If the answer is wrong, the game ends immediately.
Time Delay:

After each question, the program waits for 10 seconds using time.sleep(10).
Game End:

If the player answers two questions correctly, the game exits the loop and ends.
Improvements Needed:
There's an issue in for i in list1, answer:‚Äîthis should be replaced with a proper iteration over list1.
The game should handle cases where the user doesn't enter a valid input.
A timer mechanism should be added to ensure the user responds within 10 seconds, rather than just pausing execution.

# 6. LUCKY GAME
Working of the Lucky Game:
This is a simple luck-based betting game where the player wagers money and tries to match symbols to win rewards. The game uses random selection to determine outcomes, simulating a slot-machine-style experience.

How It Works:
Starting Balance:

The player starts with ‚Çπ50 in their wallet (balance=50).
Game Start:

The user is asked if they want to play ("y") or exit ("n").
If they choose "y", another menu is displayed with game options.
If they choose "n", the game ends.
Game Menu Options:

(1) Check Balance:
Displays the current balance.
If the balance is low, it suggests depositing money.
(2) Exit the Game:
Ends the game with a farewell message.
(3) Deposit Money:
The user can add money to their wallet.
(4) Play the Game:
The user enters a bet amount (amount1).
If the bet is higher than the balance, a warning is displayed.
If the bet is valid, the game randomly generates three symbols using the random.choice() function.
Winning Conditions:

Jackpot (Triple Match):
If all three symbols match, the player wins double their bet.
Close Win (Two Matches):
If only two symbols match, the player loses their bet but gets a message that they were close.
Total Loss (No Matches):
If none of the symbols match, the player loses the bet.
Game Loop:

The game continues until the player chooses to exit (choice == 2).
# 7. FILE MANAGER SYSTEM
Working of the File Manager System
This is a File Manager System in Python that allows users to create, read, write, delete, and edit files through a menu-based interface. It uses the os module for file management.

üîπ Features & Working Explanation
1Ô∏è‚É£ Create File (create_file(filename))

If the file does not exist, it creates a new file.
If the file already exists, it shows a warning.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Read File (read_file(filename))

Opens the file and displays its content.
If the file does not exist, it shows an error message.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Write to File (write_file(filename))

Takes new input from the user and overwrites the existing file.
If the file does not exist, it creates a new file.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Delete File (delete_file(filename))

Removes the specified file permanently.
If the file does not exist, it shows an error.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Edit (Append) File (edit_info(filename))

Takes additional input from the user and appends it to the file.
If the file does not exist, it shows an error.
6Ô∏è‚É£ Exit (choice == 6)

Stops the program execution.

# 8. Tic-Tac-Toe
Working of the Game
This is a two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game where Player X and Player O take turns to place their marks on a 3x3 grid. The game runs until:
‚úÖ A player wins by forming a row, column, or diagonal.
üîÑ It's a draw (when all 9 positions are filled and no one wins).

What‚Äôs Used in the Game?
Lists (board) ‚Äì Represents the game board.
print_board() function ‚Äì Displays the current state of the board.
check_winner() function ‚Äì Checks if a player has won.
valid_move() function ‚Äì Ensures a move is valid and prevents overwriting.
Loop for turns ‚Äì Alternates between Player X and Player O.
Win/Draw condition handling ‚Äì Stops the game if someone wins or if it's a draw.
