# 1. DICE SEMULATION
Working of the Game:
I am using the time module and random module in this project. The game operates within two while loops:

First Loop:
Controls whether the player wants to play the game or exit.
Second Loop:
Handles the actual gameplay.
The first turn is always for the user.
The second turn is for the computer, which makes random moves using the random module.
Additional Features:
I am using user-defined functions to manage different parts of the game efficiently.
Only the user can stop the game by giving a command—the computer will never stop on its own.
This makes the game more interactive and engaging, providing an interesting experience for the player.
# 2. HOTEL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

my project is a real-life Café Management System that uses Python and MySQL with the mysql.connector module. It interacts with a MySQL database to store and manage the café's menu, allowing customers to place orders and generate bills.

How It Works:
1.The system performs SQL queries to fetch, insert, create, and delete data from the MySQL database.
2.It provides a user-friendly interface with logical loops and conditions to handle the order-taking process efficiently.
3.Customers can view the menu, place orders, confirm orders, and generate bills dynamically.
4.The system calculates the total bill based on selected items and their prices from the database.
5.It simulates a real café environment, where waiters (referred to as "better" in the program) take orders and process payments.

# 3. LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
--->working: This Python script implements a Library Management System that allows three types of users—teachers, students, and administrators—to log in and perform various tasks related to books. The system interacts with a MySQL database using the mysql.connector library and utilizes bcrypt for password hashing and authentication.
Main Components & Functionality:
1. User Authentication & Role-Based Access. 2. Teacher Login & Operations. 3. Student Login & Operations. 4. Admin Login & Privileges. 5. Database Connectivity & Queries
# 4. CONTACT APP
Working of the Contact Diary App
The Contact Diary App is a Python-based application that allows users to store, search, count, and delete contacts using a MySQL database. It provides a menu-driven interface for easy interaction and ensures that contacts are securely stored and managed.

2️⃣ Menu-Driven Interface

3️⃣ Error Handling & Optimization

# CONBANEGA CORORPATI APP
Working of the Code:
This program is a quiz game inspired by Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC), where the player answers multiple-choice questions within a time limit of 10 seconds per question.

How It Works:
Modules Used:

The time module is imported to introduce a 10-second delay after each question.
Question Storage:

A list of dictionaries, list1, stores the questions along with four answer options (A, B, C, D).
The correct answers are stored separately in the answer list.
Game Start:

The user types "start" to begin the game.
Loop Execution:

The while True loop ensures the game runs continuously.
A prize money system starts at ₹10,000, increasing by ₹20,000 for each correct answer.
An index variable keeps track of the question number.
Asking Questions:

The program displays a question with answer options.
The user selects an option (A, B, C, or D).
If the answer is correct, the user wins money, and the game proceeds to the next question.
If the answer is wrong, the game ends immediately.
Time Delay:

After each question, the program waits for 10 seconds using time.sleep(10).
Game End:

If the player answers two questions correctly, the game exits the loop and ends.
Improvements Needed:
There's an issue in for i in list1, answer:—this should be replaced with a proper iteration over list1.
The game should handle cases where the user doesn't enter a valid input.
A timer mechanism should be added to ensure the user responds within 10 seconds, rather than just pausing execution.
